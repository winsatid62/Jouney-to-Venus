FDBK : Tip: You can use MOVE to go to doors or objects. (E.G. MOVE FRONT DOOR) and moving to doors will go to the room beyond that door.
FDBK : Tip: You can INSPECT some object for more detail.
Lacroff : I wonder if I add more text, will the program deal with it correctly. This longggggggg string of text is just to test wrapping and spacing of the text.
